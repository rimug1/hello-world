# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub
This is a little about myself. I am self-taught in most aspects of computer knowledge.
This knowledge is mainly limited to Apple Macintosh products. My knowledge of coding
is cross-platform, but when push comes to shove, my areas are towards Macintosh and Adobe's
Creative Suite and Microsoft Office.
